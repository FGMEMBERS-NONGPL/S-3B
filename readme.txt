Description:
U.S. only Jet aircraft, used in the detection and attack of submarines, and as an armed scout in the anti-surface role. Extremely versatile, the aircraft is also equipped for tanking, mining, and limited electronic surveillance.

Features:
Full animation, Full night lighting (Military), Nose wheel steering, Fowler flaps, Arresting Hook and FS2K .air file. Carrier landable as accurate as can be using the ( / ) Spoiler key to stop. Don't use the spoiler key inflight, the S3 does'nt fly very good a 0 knots. Hook will
deploy with full flaps selected, but will have no effect on stopping.  
 
Light Controls:
The green formation lights come on automatically at night.
Turn on the Nosewheel Landing Light with "L", turn off "Shift L and or
Ctrl L". 
Turn on the Strobes and Nav Lights with "L".
 
Installation
Unzip all files to a temporary folder, then move the unzipped folder to 
your FS2000\Aircraft folder. There are 2 Model files. The file named
"model" is for NO outside views like the default FS2K a/c. The 
"model wing views" file has the wing views included for those who like them. If you prefer no outside views, nothing needs to be done to the
"model" file and you can delete the "model wing views" file. If you prefer wing views, you will need to delete the "model" file and rename the "model wing views" to "model". I've included the default lear panel and sounds but you should replace these with whatever you would like to use. As far as I know, any 2 engine jet panel programed for a FS2K .air
file will work. A suggestion for sounds is Mike Hambly's A10 sound files (a102ksnd.zip) downloadable at Flightsim.com. (The A10 and S3 have the same engines).

Abacus & Louis Sinclair/Tom Greenwalt for FS Design Studio
Felix/FFDS (for his patience and knowledge)
Konstantin Kukushkin for Aircraft Animator
Viking for his "Making an Aircraft" tutorial
David Eckert (daviator) for his new idea on his website and help!
Massimo Taccoli for the Pilot and Seat from his f104gfsc file 
Mike Hill for his original S3A Viking Design. Although I did not use
any of the original S3A parts, I did use the .AFX for the Backdrops and
portions of the .air file.
If I forgot anyone....Sorry, my mind isn't what it use to be.

Disclaimer:
I have designed this version from scratch using FS Design Studio(tm)
Version 1.42, and Aircraft Animator Version 1.2E. This Aircraft will work in FS2000 and CFS2, but the lighting in CFS2 is hosed-up? If this A/C dumps your computer, I am not responsible. I have tested this aircraft for over a month and have never had a lock-up or any other problem. My system configuration is WinME, PIII450 (ockld to 504) with 256MB SDRAM, VooDoo3 3000.
